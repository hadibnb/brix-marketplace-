# BRIX Marketplace — Multi-language Frontend Prototype

This repository is a complete static frontend prototype for BRIX Marketplace with full i18n support (English, Persian (fa), Arabic (ar)).
It includes:
- index.html (landing + products + checkout)
- product.html (product details)
- seller.html (seller upload form)
- dashboard.html (user dashboard)
- styles/styles.css
- scripts/i18n.js (translations) and scripts/app.js (product/cart logic)
- assets placeholders and docs

Open `index.html` in a browser to run locally. Use `setLang('en'|'fa'|'ar')` or language buttons to switch languages on the fly.
